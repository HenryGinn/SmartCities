In this section a selection of features in the crime data that could potentially be used to inform and assist policymakers are presented. First an overview of crime in London is given in figure~\ref{} showing that Westminster is a hot spot and that Theft and Violence Against the Person are the most common crimes. Kensingston and Chelsea is then identified as an outlier from the choropleth plots, and these are findings are shown in figure~\ref{}. Study of animations revealed further anomolies in Kensington and Chelsea where rates of drug related offences peak periodically in august, as demonstrated in figure~\ref{}. Finally the time series themselves are analysed, and the trend in Public Order Offenses is shown in figure~\ref{} as a highlight. The crime rate for this category has been increasing significantly in many LSOA regions, and LSOA Figure~\ref{} shows LSOA region E01034220 which has been selected as a particularly bad example, with crime rate increasing by around three orders of magnitude over the 14 year period.
