Burglary is consistently uniform, although

Barking and Dagenham
6 times more crime occurs in the LSOA just south of the station than the median LSOA, and 5% of total crime. They are particularly concentrated here for public order offences and violence against the person.
Almost all crime for all categories occurs around Barking station in the town centre, but there are some exceptions to this 
	The north side of Dagenham Heathway station has the second most drug offences (first being the centre of Barking). The crimes are very concentrated in this area, where interestingly the south side has significantly fewer crimes.
	A more industrial area in the south of the borough has a significant number of vehicle offences
	
The theft rate in Barnet is around ten times higher in the town centre as other LSOAs
There are three theft hotspots in Barnet: the main high street, Erith, and a retail park called Crayford
In Brent the places, where people lived was not that good an indicator of where vehicle theft occured. The top area was around some big box stores and the other was in a large business park. They had 1721 and 1176 offences, and everything else was a few hundred, the third highest being 638.

I want to look at the correlation between theft and violence against the person in Camden and Westiminster. In Westminster they correlate very strongly, but in camden there is an area of high theft, but with lower crime
